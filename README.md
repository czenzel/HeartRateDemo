## Description

This project uses Microsoft .NET MAUI from Microsoft .NET SDK 7.x. It uses the pre-release Shiny Bluetooth Library along with Dependency Injection (DI) to create a fully working solution to scan and connect to a nearby heart rate monitor and actively read the heart rate over a specified period of time.
